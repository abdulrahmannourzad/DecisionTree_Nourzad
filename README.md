**Decision trees :** 
- **Decision trees** are a popular and powerful tool used in various fields such as machine learning, data mining, and statistics. They provide a clear and intuitive way to make decisions based on data by modeling the relationships between different variables.

- A **decision tree** is a flowchart-like structure used to make decisions or predictions. It consists of nodes representing decisions or tests on attributes, branches representing the outcome of these decisions, and leaf nodes representing final outcomes or predictions. Each internal node corresponds to a test on an attribute, each branch corresponds to the result of the test, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label or a continuous value.


**Titanic dataset :**
- It is one of the most popular datasets used for understanding machine learning basics. It contains information of all the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which unfortunately was shipwrecked.
- This dataset can be used to predict whether a given passenger survived or not.
